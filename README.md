# Image-Reranking
My project for improving the performance of image re-ranking. It is basically based on two relevant papers, which are "Query-adaptive image re-ranking using deep convolutional neural network feature" and "Visual re-ranking through greedy selection and rank fusion" respectively.

The code mainly comprises of ..parts, including Visual Rank, Graph-based re-ranking, query difficulty estimation and rank fusion.
